# Rust Linked List Exercises

This repository contains a collection of hands-on exercises designed to help you learn and practice linked list manipulation, memory management, and the use of `Box` and `Option` in Rust. It consists of a shared library crate for the `ListNode` struct and individual binary crates for each exercise, organized in a single Cargo workspace.

## Exercises

1. **Simple Singly Linked List**: Create a basic singly linked list with insertion and display functionalities.
2. **Reverse a Singly Linked List**: Write a function to reverse a singly linked list in place.
3. **Find the Middle Node**: Write a function to find the middle node of a singly linked list.
4. **Remove a Node with a Given Value**: Write a function to remove the first occurrence of a given value from a singly linked list.
5. **Check if a Singly Linked List is a Palindrome**: Write a function to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
6. **Merge Two Sorted Singly Linked Lists**: Write a function to merge two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted list.
7. **Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Singly Linked List**: Write a function to remove duplicate nodes from a sorted singly linked list.

For each exercise, focus on understanding how `Box`, `Option`, and `ListNode` work together and how to use them effectively. Pay attention to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, as they are essential when working with complex data structures like linked lists.
